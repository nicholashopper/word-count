Welcome to the H-E-B Developer I Programming Challenge!
Thank you for your interest in a career in software development at H-E-B. This challenge will be used to
assess your technical skills. We will be looking for your utilization of design patterns, best practices, and
the simplicity and quality of your code.
You will have two (2) days to complete the challenge. When your solution is completed, upload the
project to GitHub and send a link to sadc@heb.com. If selected to move forward in the interview
process, you will be expected to demo your application in-person with your own laptop, and you will
review your entire solution with several H-E-B developers. Please anticipate providing details regarding
not only your code, but your overall design decisions.
We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to complete this challenge and wish you the best of luck!
